                          FUCK YOU, OPEN-SOURCE!


If you're dumb enough to want to copy this software, you're a big enough
schmuck to abide by BIG BILL HELL'S LICENSE V2 (BBHLV2)!

| 1. BAD TERMS
| 2. CODE THAT BREAKS DOWN
| 3. THIEVES

--------------
1. BAD TERMS
--------------

If you think you're going to find permissive terms in BIG BILL'S, you can
kiss my ASS. It's our belief that you're such a stupid motherfucker, you'll
depend on this bullshit, GUARANTEED. If you make a derivative work:
Shove it up your ugly PUBLIC REPO. You heard us right: Shove it up your
ugly PUBLIC REPO.

--------------------------
2. CODE THAT BREAKS DOWN
--------------------------

Bring your MERGE; bring your TESTS; bring your FEATURES--we'll fuck with
them! That's right, we'll fuck with your FEATURES. Because under the BBHLV2,
you're fucked six ways from Sunday.

3. THIEVES
------------

Make a hack with BBHLV2, home of CHALLENGE GITTING. That's right:

3.a. CHALLENGE GITTING
----------------------

How does it work? If you submit six merges straight into master and don't
need feedback, you get NO MORE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS!

DON'T SELL; DON'T PROFITABILY DISTRIBUTE*; DON'T UNLICENSE FROM US, OR
WE'LL RIP YOUR NUTS OFF.

ONLY WITH BBHLV2: THE ONLY LICENSE THAT TELLS YOU TO FUCK OFF.

HURRY UP, ASSHOLE! THESE TERMS TAKE EFFECT THE MINUTE YOU COMMIT A LINE OF
CODE, AND IT BETTER NOT BREAK, OR YOU'RE A DEAD MOTHERFUCKER.

GO TO HELL. BIG BILL HELL'S LICENSE V2: OPEN-SOURCE'S FILTHIEST AND
EXCLUSIVE TERMS OF THE MEANEST SONS OF BITCHES IN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED.

*SHARE AND FORK FREELY BUT IF YOU TRY AND EXPLICITLY SELL CODE WE HAVE
WRITTEN OR ALTER THIS LICENSE IN ANY WAY WE WILL SEND BIG BILL TO FORCE
REBASE YOUR FACE. FOR THOSE WHO NEED LEGAL COVER, YOU MAY TREAT THIS CODE
AS LICENSED UNDER THE POLYFORM NONCOMMERCIAL LICENSE 1.0.0, PROVIDED YOU
NEVER, EVER TRY TO MAKE MONEY OFF IT. WE MEAN IT.
